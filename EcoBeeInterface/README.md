# Interface between an Ecobee smart thermostat and an RV 12V AC system.

I put this here just so I wouldn't lose it - the RV it was designed for was traded-in and the older Ecobee's went with it.  It was an interesting project that was extremely useful.  

I never finished adding the furnace system to the project, but that looked like it was going to be pretty much the same as the AC interface.
